I love non-fiction. I love hearing (or reading) people&amp;rsquo;s stories. I love when a non-fiction piece is a true page turner. Most of all, I love when something read in a book lines up with life in such a way that feels as if the author &lt;strong>knew&lt;/strong> it was meant for you. Partly great book buying by the consumer, partly great book recommending by a friend (or algorithm), or maybe, they&amp;rsquo;re a very good author capable of targeting a wide audience. All wins!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
