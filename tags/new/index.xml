We aren&amp;rsquo;t taught they are mutually exclusive but in general, they are separate because business people don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to know engineering concepts and engineers &lt;em>should&lt;/em> just focus on engineering. This is a typical argument for separation of duties &amp;ndash; why do people &lt;em>need to know&lt;/em> how the other thing works if they can be really good at one thing?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Why?</title><link>https://jenniferpweir.com/blog/2025/08/28/my-why/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 17:16:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jenniferpweir.com/blog/2025/08/28/my-why/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey all!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In college, I was a member of the Internal Relations Committee for GEECS (Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at the University of Michigan. For 4 semesters, I helped plan internal events and wrote blog posts that were shared in a distribution list to members of the org. With each post, I learned a lot about writing for an audience and gained valuable feedback that helped me craft future applications, proposals, and competition submissions for various professional events.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
