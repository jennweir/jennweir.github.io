Specifically, assignments that surrounded the idea of &amp;ldquo;interdisciplinarity in a world of boxes&amp;rdquo;. While the idea did not have huge impact on my work at the time, I found myself returning to it as a solution that always seemed to &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo; for projects later on &amp;ndash; introducing a new, valuable set of additional solutions every time. Interdisciplinarity weaves in local politics when you would otherwise only be focused on constructing a new highway next to a small town, it weaves in hurtful stereotypes when you would otherwise only be focused on building a new social media app, and it considers all parties viewpoints while signing an engineering contract, not after the fact.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Business &amp; Engineering</title><link>https://jenniferpweir.com/blog/2025/09/05/business-engineering/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 02:46:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jenniferpweir.com/blog/2025/09/05/business-engineering/</guid><description>&lt;p>From grade school to higher education, business and engineering an treated as separate subjects. In general, they are separate because &amp;ldquo;business people don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to know engineering concepts and engineers should just focus on engineering&amp;rdquo;, right? This is a typical argument for separation of duties &amp;ndash; why do people &lt;em>need to know&lt;/em> how the other thing works if they can be really good at one thing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the real world, we see business and engineering become increasingly intertwined as problems become complex. Realistically, these two subjects are extremely reliant on each other because &lt;em>people are complex&lt;/em>. From a corporate perspective, engineering needs to be funded and business doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen unless there is some (typically engineered in some way) product to exchange. In every case, people are consumers of these types of transactions. Corporate organizational structures assign eccentric titles and positions, divide departments, and restructure responsibilities in an attempt to make sense of these complex systems; however, there is a common denominator in every case: business and engineering are treated as separate entities until it really matters to treat them as one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Why?</title><link>https://jenniferpweir.com/blog/2025/08/28/my-why/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 17:16:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jenniferpweir.com/blog/2025/08/28/my-why/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey all!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In college, I was a member of the Internal Relations Committee for GEECS (Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at the University of Michigan. For 4 semesters, I helped plan internal events and wrote blog posts that were shared in a distribution list to members of the org. With each post, I learned a lot about writing for an audience and gained valuable feedback that helped me craft future applications, proposals, and competition submissions for various professional events.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
