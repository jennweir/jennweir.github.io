&lt;p>In college, I was a member of the Internal Relations Committee for GEECS (Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at the University of Michigan. For 4 semesters, I helped plan internal events and wrote blog posts that were shared in a distribution list to members of the org. With each post, I learned a lot about writing for an audience and gained valuable feedback that helped me craft future applications, proposals, and competition submissions for various professional events.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
