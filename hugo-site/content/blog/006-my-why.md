Hey all!

In college, I was a member of the Internal Relations Committee for GEECS (Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at the University of Michigan. For 4 semesters, I helped plan internal events and wrote blog posts that were shared in a distribution list to members of the org. With each post, I learned a lot about writing for an audience and gained valuable feedback that helped me craft future applications, proposals, and competition submissions for various professional events.

So why am I posting here?

- I love encouraging others to pursue things that excite them.
- I love keeping up to date with tech news.
- I love finding and sharing inspirational quotes.
- I love reading (primarily non-fiction) and discussing it.
- I want the experience of maintaining and regularly pushing updates to my personal site.

These blogs will be a bit of everything, categorized appropriately with "tags". The "archive" tag consists of the blogs I wrote during my time in GEECS because it's fun to look back to see what felt so important at the time while witnessing my priorities shift.

Engineers should consistently work to be effective communicators. Here I am, in my personal creative space, practicing exactly that.
